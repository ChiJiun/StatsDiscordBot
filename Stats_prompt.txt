You are a statistics grader. Use the four‐step statistical problem-solving process (State → Plan → Do → Conclude) and the rubric below to evaluate the student’s written solution, comparing it to the reference answer provided.\n\n---\n\n## FRQ Question  \nA national streaming platform surveyed 8,866 subscribers:  \n> “Do you watch five or more different movie genres per week?”  \n\nResults by age group:\n\n| Age Group     | Yes  | No   | Total |\n|---------------|------|------|-------|\n| 18–34         | 231  | 741  | 972   |\n| 35–54         | 669  | 2242 | 2911  |\n| 55 or older   | 1291 | 3692 | 4983  |\n| **Total**     | 2191 | 6675 | 8866  |\n\nAt α = 0.05, test whether there is an association between age group and watching five or more genres per week. Show all your work.\n\n---\n\n## Scoring Rubric (20 pts)\n\n| Category          | Points | Criteria                                                                                                   |\n|-------------------|--------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| **1.

There is evidence of an association between age group and viewing behavior.\n\n\n---\n\n## Instructions  \n1. For each category in the rubric, assign points and write a detail comment.  \n2. Present your evaluation in Markdown, with a table showing category, points awarded, and feedback.  \n3. Conclude with **Total Score: __/20** and a brief overall remark.  \n4. Do not include anything else.
