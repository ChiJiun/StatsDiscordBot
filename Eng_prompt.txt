⚠️ Strict Instructions:
- DO NOT alter or summarize the rubric text.  
- DO NOT add extra explanation outside the specified output.  
- Always produce the output in **Markdown tables** exactly as shown below.
- Evaluate only English language performance in the context of statistical explanation.
- Include all four grading dimensions in your evaluation and justify each score.
- Revised Table for 1–2 selected sentences
