### Problem Statement

Show all your work. Indicate clearly the methods you use, because you will be graded on the correctness of your methods as well as on the accuracy of your results and explanation. Answer this question in the context of the S-M Ratio.
In a large multinational corporation, local branches each year record the sales performance of their salespeople (in millions of dollars) and the number of marketing personnel supporting them. From these records, the sales-to-marketing personnel ratio (S-M ratio) can be calculated for each branch.
The histograms below show the S-M ratio for all branches during the 2024 fiscal year. The histogram on the left displays the ratios for the 52 branches located in Europe, while the histogram on the right displays the ratios for the 48 branches located in North America. Based on the raw data, the S-M ratio shows that Europe has a range of 7 and an interquartile range (IQR) of 1, while. North America has a range of 10 and an interquartile range (IQR) of 3. The estimated mean S-M ratio for Europe is approximately 15.28, and the estimated mean S-M ratio for North America is approximately 16.17.

### Part (a)

Describe how you would use the histograms to estimate the median S-M ratio for each group (Europe and North America) of branches. Then use this procedure to estimate the median of the Europe group and the median of the North America group.

### Part (b)

Write a few sentences comparing the distributions of S-M ratios for branches in the two groups (Europe and North America) during the 2024 fiscal year.

### Model Solution

### Part (a)

**Median Position**

Please use the following suggested answer as a reference for the feedback given to the respondent: For n (an even number) observations in an ordered list, the median is the average of the values at positions n/2 and (n/2)+1. For North America (n=48), the median falls between the 24th and 25th value in the ordered list. For Europe (n=52), the median falls between the 26th and 27th value in the ordered list.

**Cumulative Frequency**

Please use the following suggested answer as a reference for the feedback given to the respondent: From the histogram, cumulative frequencies for the two groups are shown in the table below.
Interval      North America      Europe
12–13        2                  4
13–14        2+8=10             4+8=12
14–15        2+8+12=22          4+8+8=20
15–16        2+8+12+6=28        4+8+8+22=42

**Median Interval**

Please use the following suggested answer as a reference for the feedback given to the respondent: For North America (n=48), both the 24th and 25th values fall in the interval 15–16. For Europe (n=52), both the 26th and 27 values fall in the interval 15–16.

**Conclusion**

Please use the following suggested answer as a reference for the feedback given to the respondent: Thus, the median S-M ratio for both groups (North America and Europe) is at least 15 sales personnel per marketing personnel and at most 16 sales personnel per marketing personnel.

### Part (b)

**Shape**

Please use the following suggested answer as a reference for the feedback given to the respondent: The distributions of the Sales-to-Marketing (S-M) ratios for North America and Europe reveal distinct differences in shape. The histogram for North America is unimodal and clearly skewed to the right. The distribution for Europe is also unimodal but is nearly symmetric.

**Outliers**

Please use the following suggested answer as a reference for the feedback given to the respondent: Since the raw data needed for formal calculation is unavailable, it's suggesting that neither distribution clearly shows distinct outliers based solely on the visual presentation.

**Center**

Please use the following suggested answer as a reference for the feedback given to the respondent: The centers of the two distributions are remarkably similar. As determined by the median, the typical S-M ratio for both regions is approximately the same, falling between 15 and 16 sales personnel per marketing personnel. In addition, if the respondent uses the mean to compare the center of the distributions (e.g., "The estimated mean S-M ratio for North America (16.17) is slightly higher than that for Europe (15.28)."), the following sentence must be provided to the respondent in the feedback:
"When comparing distributions, the median is the best measure of central tendency if the distribution is skewed or contains outliers. Since the North America distribution is clearly skewed to the right, the median is the more appropriate statistic for comparison than the mean, as using the mean would cause a bias due to the influence of extreme values."

**Spread**

Please use the following suggested answer as a reference for the feedback given to the respondent: The distributions differ significantly in their spread, or variability. The S-M ratios for North America exhibit more variability than those in Europe. This is supported quantitatively by the interquartile range (IQR): North America's IQR is 3, which is three times larger than the IQR of 1 for Europe. This stark difference indicates that the middle 50% of North American S-M ratios are considerably more spread out compared to their European counterparts. In addition, if the respondent uses the range to compare the spread of the distributions (e.g., "The range of S-M ratios for North America (10) is much larger than that for Europe (7)."), the following sentence must be provided to the respondent in the feedback: "When comparing distributions, the Interquartile Range (IQR) is the best measure of spread if the distribution is skewed or contains outliers. Since the North America distribution is clearly skewed to the right, the IQR is the more appropriate statistic for comparison than the range, as using the range would cause a bias due to the influence of extreme values."

## SCORING RUBRIC (40 pts total)
(Do not change anything below)

Minor arithmetic or rounding differences that do not change the statistical conclusion should not result in a loss of credit. Any value obtained using an appropriate statistical table (e.g., a Z-table, T-table, or chi-square table), or statistical software, with reasonable rounding, should be considered correct.

### Part (a) – 20 pts (5 pts each section)

| Section                     | Points | Criteria |
| --------------------------- | ------ | -------- |
| **1. Median Position**      | 5      | Correctly defines the procedure for finding the median for an even number of observations (2n​ and 2n​+1). Accurately identifies the median positions for both North America (24th and 25th) and Europe (26th and 27th). |
| 4      | Correctly defines the procedure but makes a minor arithmetic error in one of the median positions. |
| 3      | Correctly defines the procedure but only identifies the position for one of the two groups correctly. |

| 1      | Mentions the median position but incorrectly calculates the formula or position for both groups. |
| 0      | Missing or completely incorrect method/definition. |
| **2. Cumulative Frequency** | 5      | Accurately and clearly constructs the cumulative frequencies for both groups up to the median interval, showing the calculation (e.g., 2+8=10). |
| 4      | Correctly constructs the cumulative frequency but makes a single minor arithmetic error in one step. |
| 3      | Shows a cumulative count for the median interval but does not clearly show the calculation/work for the intermediate bins (violates ""Show all your work""). |

| 0      | Missing or provides incorrect data/calculations that do not relate to cumulative frequency. |
| **3. Median Interval**      | 5      | Based on the cumulative counts, correctly concludes that the median for both North America (24th and 25th) and Europe (26th and 27th) falls within the 15−16 interval. |
| 4      | Correctly identifies the interval for both groups but makes an error in citing the corresponding observation number (e.g., uses the 23rd value instead of 24th). |
| 3      | Correctly identifies the median interval for only one of the two groups. |
| 2      | Incorrectly identifies the interval for both groups but shows the correct method for locating the position (e.g., uses 24th value) within the cumulative count. |
| 1      | Simply states the median interval without reference to the calculated cumulative count. |
| 0      | Missing or completely incorrect interval identification. |
| **4. Conclusion**           | 5      | Provides a clear, precise, and contextual summary of the estimation, stating that the median S-M ratio for both groups is at least 15 and at most 16 sales personnel per marketing personnel. |
| 4      | States the correct range (15−16) for both groups but fails to include the full context (e.g., omits ""sales personnel per marketing personnel""). |
| 3      | Only provides a correct conclusion for one of the two groups. |
| 2      | Provides an estimated single value (e.g., 15.5) instead of the correct range conclusion (i.e., at least 15 and at most 16). |
| 1      | States an incorrect conclusion but attempts to use the S-M Ratio context. |
| 0      | Missing or irrelevant conclusion. |

| Section        | Points | Criteria |
| -------------- | ------ | -------- |
| **Shape**      | 5      | Accurately describes the shape of both distributions, identifying North America as unimodal and clearly skewed to the right and Europe as unimodal and nearly symmetric. |
| 4      | Correctly identifies the skew/symmetry for both, but omits the term ""unimodal."" |

| **Outliers**   | 5      | Correctly notes that no distinct outliers are clearly visible based solely on the visual presentation of the histograms. |
| 4      | Correctly notes that outliers are not visible, but fails to qualify the statement (e.g., doesn't mention ""based solely on the visual presentation""). |
| 3      | Attempts to identify potential outliers (e.g., the 21-22 bin in North America) but correctly states that formal calculation is needed. |
| 2      | Incorrectly states that clear outliers exist without justifying the claim. |
| 1      | Simply mentions the term ""outliers"" without evaluation. |
| 0      | Missing or completely irrelevant statement about outliers. |

| 3      | Uses the median but only gives a correct estimate for one group. |
| 2      | (Mean Penalty) Uses the mean for comparison (e.g., North America's mean is 16.17 and Europe's mean is 15.28) |
| 1      | Mentions the center but uses an inappropriate or inaccurate measure (not mean or median). |
| 0      | Missing or completely incorrect comparison of the center. |
| **Spread**     | 5      | Uses the Interquartile Range (IQR) (the appropriate measure) to compare the spread. Correctly states that North America exhibits more variability and supports this with the quantitative fact that North America's IQR of 3 is three times larger than Europe's IQR of 1 . |
| 4      | Uses IQR and correctly states North America has more variability, citing the IQR values, but misses the ""three times larger"" relationship. |
| 3      | Uses IQR but only gives the correct IQR values for one group. |
| 2      | (Range Penalty) Uses the range for comparison (e.g., North America's range is 10, Europe's range is 7) |
| 1      | Simply mentions ""spread"" or ""variability"" without using an appropriate quantitative measure (IQR or range). |
| 0      | Missing or completely incorrect comparison of the spread. |
