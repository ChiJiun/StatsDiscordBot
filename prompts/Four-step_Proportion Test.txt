### Problem Statement

A technology company wants to estimate the true mean handling time (in seconds) for all customer service calls. To do so, they selected a random sample of 4 calls and calculated the mean handling time to be 110 seconds. Assuming the population of all call handling times is normally distributed, suppose the population standard deviation from past records has been 40 seconds. Construct and interpret a 99% confidence interval for the true mean handling time (μ) of all customer service calls. Based on this interval, does it appear that the true mean handling time (μ) is different from a previously established benchmark of 90 seconds? Show all steps using the SPDC structure.

### Model Solution

### State

A Context of the study: On-time delivery performance of a local e-commerce branch.
B Parameter: Let ppp be the true proportion of orders delivered on time at this branch.
C Null hypothesis: H0:p=0.8H_0: p = 0.8H0:p=0.8 
D Alternative hypothesis (left-tailed): Ha:p<0.8H_a: p < 0.8Ha:p<0.8 
E Given information: n=60,x=41,p^=4160=0.683,α=0.05n = 60,\quad x = 41,\quad \hat{p} = \frac{41}{60} = 0.683,\quad \alpha = 0.05n=60,x=41,p^=6041=0.683,α=0.05

### Plan

A Random condition: The problem states that the data come from a simple random sample (SRS).
B Independence condition (10% rule): The sample size of 60 orders is less than 10% of all orders at the branch, so observations can be treated as independent.
C Large Counts condition: np0=60(0.8)=48≥10np_0 = 60(0.8) = 48 \ge 10np0=60(0.8)=48≥10 
D Large Counts condition: n(1−p0)=60(0.2)=12≥10n(1 - p_0) = 60(0.2) = 12 \ge 10n(1−p0)=60(0.2)=12≥10 
E Test selection: Since all conditions are satisfied, a one-proportion z-test is appropriate.

### Do

A Sample proportion: p^=4160=0.683\hat{p} = \frac{41}{60} = 0.683p^=6041=0.683 
B Standard error (using p0p_0p0): p0(1−p0)n=0.8(0.2)60\sqrt{\frac{p_0(1 - p_0)}{n}} = \sqrt{\frac{0.8(0.2)}{60}}np0(1−p0)=600.8(0.2) 
C Test statistic: z=p^−p0p0(1−p0)/n=0.683−0.80.8(0.2)/60≈−2.27z = \frac{\hat{p} - p_0}{\sqrt{p_0(1 - p_0)/n}} = \frac{0.683 - 0.8}{\sqrt{0.8(0.2)/60}} \approx -2.27z=p0(1−p0)/np^−p0=0.8(0.2)/600.683−0.8≈−2.27 
D p-value (left-tailed test): p-value=P(Z≤−2.27)≈0.0116\text{p-value} = P(Z \le -2.27) \approx 0.0116p-value=P(Z≤−2.27)≈0.0116 
E Comparison with significance level: 0.0116<0.050.0116 < 0.050.0116<0.05

### Conclude

A Decision: Since the p-value is less than the significance level, we reject H0H_0H0.
B Statistical conclusion: There is convincing evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis.
C Contextual conclusion: The true proportion of on-time deliveries at this branch is less than 0.8.
D Interpretation of the p-value: If the true on-time delivery rate were 80%, the probability of observing a sample proportion of 0.683 or lower is about 1.16%, which is very unlikely.
E Business implication: See below (1), (2), and (3):
 
(1) The student earns full credit if the response meets any one of the following criteria:
•Provides a reasonable business implication that is consistent with the statistical conclusion and the given context.
•States any reasonable business implication that logically follows from the statistical conclusion.
•Interprets the statistical conclusion in the business context and states a reasonable managerial or operational implication.
•States a reasonable business implication that is consistent with both the statistical conclusion and the context of the problem.
(2) Acceptable examples (non-exhaustive):
•“The branch's delivery performance appears to be below the company standard, suggesting that management should review logistics and operational processes.”
•“The branch may need to improve its delivery system.”
•“The company should investigate why this branch performs worse.”
•“Management may consider allocating more resources to this branch.”
•“The branch’s performance does not meet company expectations.”
Note: These examples are for reference only. Any response that meets the criteria above should receive credit.
(3) Feedback if no credit is earned:
If the student does not earn credit for this component, provide specific guidance on how to revise the response, such as:
•Explicitly linking the implication to the statistical conclusion (e.g., rejecting H0H_0H0 or concluding the proportion is below the claimed value), and/or
•Clearly interpreting the result within the business context rather than restating statistical results only.]

## SCORING RUBRIC (20 pts total)
(Do not change anything below)

Minor arithmetic or rounding differences that do not change the statistical conclusion should not result in a loss of credit. Any value obtained using an appropriate statistical table (e.g., a Z-table, T-table, or chi-square table), or statistical software, with reasonable rounding, should be considered correct.
