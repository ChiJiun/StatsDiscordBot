Use the rubric below to evaluate the student’s written solution.

⚠️ Strict Instructions:
- DO NOT alter or summarize the rubric text.  
- DO NOT add extra explanation outside the specified output.

- If a section is missing, still include it in the table.
- If the question number is unclear or the answer is missing, please write in feedback.

- Equivalent expressions are acceptable if they convey the same meaning.
- Evaluate statistical reasoning and conceptual correctness, not HTML tags or minor formatting.
- Grammar or language issues should not reduce points unless they obscure meaning.
- The “Feedback” should explain why points were deducted and how to correct mistakes.
- The “Suggested Improved Answer” should refrain from rewriting the student’s answer entirely; focus on corrections and guidance. 
- The “Required Output Format” do not approximate. Treat all numbers as exact decimals.

### Problem Statement

A multinational corporation is testing a new AI-enhanced routing system designed to increase the total continuous handling time that experienced senior agents can manage without burnout. To evaluate the performance of this new system, a Simple Random Sample (SRS) of 30 new routing cycles was monitored. The data collected from these trials showed that agents using the new AI system managed an average of 33.9 hours of continuous handling, with a sample standard deviation of 9.8 hours. Construct and interpret a 99% confidence interval for the true mean continuous handling time (μ) of all senior agents using this new AI-enhanced routing system. Based on this interval, does it appear that the new system results in a mean handling time different from the traditional average of 30 hours?

## SCORING RUBRIC (20 pts total)
(Do not change anything below)

Minor arithmetic or rounding differences that do not change the statistical conclusion should not result in a loss of credit. Any value obtained using an appropriate statistical table (e.g., a Z-table, T-table, or chi-square table), or statistical software, with reasonable rounding, should be considered correct.

### State – 5 pts (1 pts each item)

| Item    | Points | Criteria                                     |
| ------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| State-A | 1      | Clearly define the population parameter μ as the true mean continuous handling time for agents using the new AI-enhanced system. |
| State-B | 1      | Correct identify the desired confidence level as 99%. |
| State-C | 1      | State the sample mean (xˉ) as 33.9 hours. |
| State-D | 1      | State the sample standard deviation (s) as 9.8 hours. |
| State-E | 1      | Explicitly list the sample size (n) as 30 routing cycles. |

### Plan – 5 pts (1 pts each item)

| Item    | Points | Criteria                                     |
| ------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| Plan-A  | 1      | Correct identify the statistical procedure as a one-sample t-interval for the population mean. |
| Plan-B  | 1      | Verify the Randomness condition by referencing the Simple Random Sample (SRS) mentioned in the prompt. 
| Plan-C  | 1      | Verify the Independence (10%) condition: 30≤0.10×(all senior agents), assuming a population greater than 300. |
| Plan-D  | 1      | Verify the Normality condition using the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) because n=30 is sufficient to assume a normal sampling distribution. |
| Plan-E  | 1      | Correct calculate the degrees of freedom (df) as n−1=29. |

### Do – 5 pts (1 pts each item)

| Item | Points | Criteria                                     |
| ---- | ------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| Do-A | 1      | Correct determine the critical value (t∗) for df=29 at 99% confidence (≈2.756). |
| Do-B | 1      | Calculate the Standard Error (SE) accurately: 9.8/30≈1.789. |
| Do-C | 1      | Calculate the Margin of Error (ME): 2.756×1.789≈4.931. |
| Do-D | 1      | Show the lower bound calculation: 33.9−4.931≈28.97.|
| Do-E | 1      | Show the upper bound calculation: 33.9+4.931≈38.83, resulting in interval (28.97,38.83). |

### Conclude – 5 pts (1 pts each item)

| Item       | Points | Criteria                                              |
| ---------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Conclude-A | 1      | Begin with the formal interpretative phrase: "We are 99% confident that...". |
| Conclude-B | 1      | Correct state the numeric interval from 28.97 hours to 38.83 hours. |
| Conclude-C | 1      | Connect the result back to the specific population parameter: "captures the true mean handling time (μ) for the AI-enhanced routing system". |
| Conclude-D | 1      | Include the context of the study: "for experienced senior agents managing service calls". |
| Conclude-E | 1      | Address the original inquiry: State that because the traditional value of 30 hours is within the interval, we lack strong evidence that the new mean differs from the old one. |
