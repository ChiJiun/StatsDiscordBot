| Section                     | Points | Criteria                                                                                                           |
| --------------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **1. Median Position**      | 5      | Correctly defines the procedure for finding the median for an even number of observations (2n​ and 2n​+1). Accurately identifies the median positions for both North America (24th and 25th) and Europe (26th and 27th). |
| 4                           | Correctly defines the procedure but makes a minor arithmetic error in one of the median positions.                                                                  |
| 3                           | Correctly defines the procedure but only identifies the position for one of the two groups correctly.                                                             |
| 2                           | Incorrectly defines the procedure (e.g., uses 2n+1​ for an even n) but attempts to apply it to both groups.                                               |
| 1                           | Mentions the median position but incorrectly calculates the formula or position for both groups.                                                     |
| 0                           | Missing or completely incorrect method/definition.                                                                                         |
| **2. Cumulative Frequency** | 5      | Accurately and clearly constructs the cumulative frequencies for both groups up to the median interval, showing the calculation (e.g., 2+8=10).                                |
| 4                           | Correctly constructs the cumulative frequency but makes a single minor arithmetic error in one step.                                                                   |
| 3                           | Shows a cumulative count for the median interval but does not clearly show the calculation/work for the intermediate bins (violates ""Show all your work"").                                            |
| 2                           | Only provides cumulative frequencies for one region, or makes multiple arithmetic errors.                                                       |
| 1                           | Lists the raw counts again without any cumulative calculation.                                                                        |
| 0                           | Missing or provides incorrect data/calculations that do not relate to cumulative frequency.                                                                                        |
| **3. Median Interval**      | 5      | Based on the cumulative counts, correctly concludes that the median for both North America (24th and 25th) and Europe (26th and 27th) falls within the 15−16 interval.                                       |
| 4                           | Correctly identifies the interval for both groups but makes an error in citing the corresponding observation number (e.g., uses the 23rd value instead of 24th).                                                               |
| 3                           | Correctly identifies the median interval for only one of the two groups.                                                                                              |
| 2                           | Incorrectly identifies the interval for both groups but shows the correct method for locating the position (e.g., uses 24th value) within the cumulative count.                                                                    |
| 1                           | Simply states the median interval without reference to the calculated cumulative count.                                                                             |
| 0                           | Missing or completely incorrect interval identification..                                                                                         |
| **4. Conclusion**           | 5      | Provides a clear, precise, and contextual summary of the estimation, stating that the median S-M ratio for both groups is at least 15 and at most 16 sales personnel per marketing personnel.                                                                  |
| 4                           | States the correct range (15−16) for both groups but fails to include the full context (e.g., omits ""sales personnel per marketing personnel"").                                                      |
| 3                           | Only provides a correct conclusion for one of the two groups.                                                                                              |
| 2                           | Provides an estimated single value (e.g., 15.5) instead of the correct range conclusion (i.e., at least 15 and at most 16).                                                                     |
| 1                           | States an incorrect conclusion but attempts to use the S-M Ratio context.                                                                                  |
| 0                           | Missing or irrelevant conclusion.                                                                                                   |

### Part (b) – 20 pts (5 pts each SOCS)

| SOCS Component | Points | Criteria                                                    |
| -------------- | ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Shape**      | 5      | Accurately describes the shape of both distributions, identifying North America as unimodal and clearly skewed to the right and Europe as unimodal and nearly symmetric. |
| 4              | Correctly identifies the skew/symmetry for both, but omits the term ""unimodal.""                            |
| 3              | Correctly identifies the shape (skew/symmetry) for only one of the two distributions.                                  |
| 2              | Describes the shape of both distributions but confuses the skew (e.g., calls North America symmetric).                                   |
| 1              | Mentions ""shape"" but only describes one feature (e.g., unimodal) for one group.                     |
| 0              | Missing or completely incorrect description of the shape.                                    |
| **Outliers**   | 5      | Correctly notes that no distinct outliers are clearly visible based solely on the visual presentation of the histograms.                 |
| 4              | Correctly notes that outliers are not visible, but fails to qualify the statement (e.g., doesn't mention ""based solely on the visual presentation"").                          |
| 3              | Attempts to identify potential outliers (e.g., the 21-22 bin in North America) but correctly states that formal calculation is needed.    |
| 2              | Incorrectly states that clear outliers exist without justifying the claim.                                  |
| 1              | Simply mentions the term ""outliers"" without evaluation.                             |
| 0              | Missing or completely irrelevant statement about outliers.                                              |
| **Center**     | 5      | Uses the median (the appropriate measure) to compare the center. Correctly states the centers are remarkably similar, falling between 15 and 16.                 |
| 4              | Uses the median and provides a correct estimate for both centers (e.g., 15.5) but fails to explicitly state that the centers are similar.               |
| 3              | Uses the median but only gives a correct estimate for one group.                                  |
| 2              | (Mean Penalty) Uses the mean for comparison (e.g., North America's mean is 16.17 and Europe's mean is 15.28)                                        |
| 1              | Mentions the center but uses an inappropriate or inaccurate measure (not mean or median).                             |
| 0              | Missing or completely incorrect comparison of the center.                                               |
| **Spread**     | 5      | Uses the Interquartile Range (IQR) (the appropriate measure) to compare the spread. Correctly states that North America exhibits more variability and supports this with the quantitative fact that North America's IQR of 3 is three times larger than Europe's IQR of 1 .                    |
| 4              | Uses IQR and correctly states North America has more variability, citing the IQR values, but misses the ""three times larger"" relationship. |
| 3              | Uses IQR but only gives the correct IQR values for one group.                                     |
| 2              | (Range Penalty) Uses the range for comparison (e.g., North America's range is 10, Europe's range is 7)                                          |
| 1              | Simply mentions ""spread"" or ""variability"" without using an appropriate quantitative measure (IQR or range).                        |
| 0              | Missing or completely incorrect comparison of the spread.                                               |
