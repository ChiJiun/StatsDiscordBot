## REFERENCE MATERIALS
(These are for your understanding only. DO NOT include them in your output.)

### Problem Statement

A nationwide retail chain reports that 47% of all customers prefer shopping with the company’s mobile app rather than in-store. A market research firm surveys 1025 randomly selected customers and records the sample proportion who prefer the mobile app.
Find the probability that the sample proportion is within 2 percentage points of the true value (47%).
Show all steps using the SPDC structure.

### Model Solution (Instructor’s Standard Answer)
(These are for your understanding only. DO NOT include them in your output.)

### State

A We are interested in the sampling distribution of the sample proportion p-hat.
B Let p = true proportion of all customers who prefer using the company’s mobile app.
C True proportion: p = 0.47
D Sample size: n = 1025 
E We want to compute: P(0.45 <= p-hat <= 0.49)

### Plan

**Randomness**

- The 1025 customers are selected at random, so the sample is representative. 
- Mean of p-hat: mu of p-hat = p = 0.47

**Independence**

- 1025 <= 0.10 * (the number of all customers in the population)
- It is reasonable to assume the company has far more than 10,250 customers.
- SD of p-hat: sigma of p-hat = sqrt(0.47 * 0.53 / 1025) approx 0.016

**Normality**

- n * p = 1025 * 0.47 >= 10
- n * (1 - p) = 1025 * 0.53 >= 10
- Both conditions are satisfied. The sampling distribution of p-hat is approximately Normal.

- We will use a Normal model for the sampling distribution of p-hat after checking the required conditions.
- p-hat follows N(0.47, 0.016)

### Do

A We want to get P(0.45 <= p-hat <= 0.49)
B Convert to Z-scores: P( (0.45 - 0.47) / 0.016 <= Z <= (0.49 - 0.47) / 0.016 )
C = P( -1.25 <= Z <= 1.25 )
D Using the standard Normal distribution:
E P(-1.25 <= Z <= 1.25) approx 0.79

### Conclude

A There is about a 0.79 probability that 
B a sample of 1025 customers 
C will produce a sample proportion 
D that is within 2 percentage points of the true population value 47%—that is, between 45% and 49%, 
E for the proportion of customers who prefer using the company’s mobile app.

## Scoring Enforcement

Every subitem must be awarded EXACTLY one of:
- Full credit = the item’s maximum points (examples: 1 or 0.5)
- Zero = 0
For Plan subitems whose maximum is 0.5, the only allowed scores are 0.5 (full) or 0 (zero).

- Do not round. Treat all numbers as exact decimals.
- Always compute subtotals and totals step-by-step with explicit arithmetic expressions.
- Scoring must be computed step-by-step to avoid summation errors.
- Always include explicit decimal addition.
- If a section is missing from the student's answer, still list all subitems and assign 0 with explanation.

For each table:
- Every subitem fill Score with the allowed values (full or zero). For Plan subitems allowed values are 0.5 or 0; for 1-point items allowed values are 1 or 0.
- Subtotal row must show the full arithmetic expression. Subtotal = a + b + c …

For the Summary table:
- Must show Total = State subtotal + Plan subtotal + Do subtotal + Conclude subtotal = XX

For Plan table:
All Plan subitems have maximum score = 0.5. Only 0.5 or 0 is allowed. Do NOT assign 1 to any Plan subitem.
| Subitem | Score | Correction and Explanation |
| ------- | ----- | -------------------------- |
| Plan-1 (max 0.5)   |       |                            |
| Plan-2 (max 0.5)   |       |                            |
| Plan-3 (max 0.5)   |       |                            |
| Plan-4 (max 0.5)   |       |                            |
| Plan-5 (max 0.5) |       |                            |
| Plan-6 (max 0.5) |       |                            |
| Plan-7 (max 0.5) |       |                            |
| Plan-8 (max 0.5)    |       |                            |
| Plan-9 (max 0.5)    |       |                            |
| Plan-10 (max 0.5)   |       |                            |
| **Subtotal** | Sum of above ten subitems |                            |
Validation: Ensure each Plan score ∈ {0, 0.5}. If any Plan score equals 1 (or other value), produce ERROR message.
Validation: Compute subtotal exactly as written. If result mismatches the arithmetic expression, produce ERROR message.

##Computation Requirements

To ensure accurate scoring and eliminate arithmetic mistakes, you must perform all calculations using a fully programmatic, step-by-step, algorithmic process:
- Treat every score as a numerical value and compute subtotals using explicit written arithmetic expressions (e.g., 0.5 + 0 + 0.5 + 0 + 0.5 = 1.5).
- Never infer or approximate the subtotal mentally. You must show every addition step explicitly.
- Do not skip intermediate calculations.
- All totals must be produced using direct arithmetic, mimicking how a computer program evaluates expressions.
- If any subtotal or total does not mathematically equal the written expression, you must output an ERROR message instead of a score.
- All computations must follow strict deterministic rules exactly as a coding algorithm—no estimation, no rounding, no reinterpretation.

This programmatic calculation rule applies to:
- All Plan 0.5-point subitems
- All 1-point items in State, Do, and Conclude sections
- Section subtotals
- The final Total = State + Plan + Do + Conclude
