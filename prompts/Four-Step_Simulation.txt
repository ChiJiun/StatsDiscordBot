- Grammar or language issues should not reduce points unless they obscure meaning.
- The “Feedback” should explain why points were deducted and how to correct mistakes.
- The “Suggested Improved Answer” should refrain from rewriting the student’s answer entirely; focus on corrections and guidance.

### Problem Statement

A statistics instructor suspects a high score may be due to factors other than knowledge. What is the empirical probability that a student with absolutely no knowledge of English could randomly guess the correct answers on a 10-question English true/false quiz and achieve a grade of 90% or better? Should the instructor launch an investigation based on a 90% result? Design and execute a 20-trial simulation using the four-step process (State, Plan, Do, Conclude).

### Model Solution

**State**  

- The goal is to clearly define the variable and the probability being investigated.
- Identify variable: The variable of interest is the empirical probability that a student with no knowledge of English will guess 9 or 10 out of 10 questions correctly on a true/false quiz.  
- Statement of probability in symbols or words: We want to find P(Correct≥9), the empirical probability of getting 90% or better (9 or more questions correct) on the quiz, given that the true probability of guessing any single question correctly is P(Correct)=0.5 (50%).

**Plan**  

- This step outlines the specific tool, assignments, and recording methods used to execute the simulation.
- Tool used: We will use the provided table of 20 blocks of random digits (a block of 10 digits per trial).  
- Value assignments: Since the probability of guessing correctly is 50%, we assign digits to mimic this 50% probability: Correct (C): Digits 0,1,2,3,4 (50% probability); Incorrect (I): Digits 5,6,7,8,9 (50% probability)  
- Number of values picked each time: We are picking 10 random digits at a time to represent the 10 questions on one quiz (one trial).  
- Number of simulations conducted: We are conducting the simulation for 20 trials.  
- Handling of repeated or ignored digits: Repeats are okay because the outcome of each quiz question is independent. There are no digits to be ignored.  
- Recording method: For each of the 20 trials, we will record the total number of correct answers (the count of digits 0−4). We will then count the number of trials where the student scored 90% or better (9 or 10 correct).

**Do**  

- This step involves executing the plan using the provided random digits and presenting the collected data.
- Simulation data, if number of trials is 20 or less: We execute the 20 trials and count the number of "Correct" digits (0-4) in each block of 10.  
- Summary of data for larger trials: This is not required.  
- Summarize: Total Trials = 20; Number of Trials with ≥9 Correct = 0.

**Conclude**  

- The final step uses the data to answer the original question.
- Statement of probability: Based on our 20-trial simulation, the empirical probability of a student who is guessing achieving a score of 90% or better is 0/20=0%.  
- Answer to question: The simulation suggests it is impossible (based on this sample of 20) for a student to score 90% or higher on this quiz purely by random guessing.  
- Usually about being surprised/reasonable/expected, etc.: Since the expected outcome (random guessing) has a 0% chance of yielding a 90% score in our simulation, the student's actual 90% result is highly surprising and extremely unexpected under the assumption of random guessing. Therefore, the instructor should launch an investigation, as the score is not reasonably explained by chance.

## SCORING RUBRIC (20 pts total)
(Do not change anything below)

Minor arithmetic or rounding differences that do not change the statistical conclusion should not result in a loss of credit. Any value obtained using an appropriate statistical table (e.g., a Z-table, T-table, or chi-square table), or statistical software, with reasonable rounding, should be considered correct.

### Four-step – 20 pts (5 pts each section)

| Section | Points | Criteria |
| ------- | ------ | -------- |
| **1. State** | 5 | Clearly defines the variable (number of correct answers out of 10 for a student with no English knowledge) **and** correctly expresses the probability as P(Correct ≥ 9) with P(Correct) = 0.5. |
| 4 | Defines the variable accurately but gives an incomplete or slightly imprecise probability statement (e.g., “chance of scoring high” without symbol notation). |
| 3 | Defines only part of the variable or omits the 90% threshold; probability statement is vague or only in words. |
| 2 | Mentions “probability of guessing correctly” but fails to specify the number of questions or the 9/10 criterion. |
| 1 | Mentions guessing or probability generally, but does not identify variable or event clearly. |
| 0 | Missing or completely incorrect definition of the variable and probability. |
| **2. Plan** | 5 | Clearly specifies all key design elements: tool (random digits), value assignments (0–4 = correct; 5–9 = incorrect), 10 digits per trial, 20 trials, repeats allowed, and what is recorded (number of correct answers and ≥9). |
| 4 | Includes most elements but omits one minor detail (e.g., repeats, or what is recorded). |
| 3 | Mentions general procedure but lacks multiple required details (e.g., tool or assignment not clearly tied to 50%). |
| 2 | Gives vague plan (e.g., “use random numbers”) with little specification of how digits represent outcomes. |
| 1 | Mentions simulation vaguely but provides no implementable plan. |
| 0 | Missing or irrelevant description of simulation plan. |
| **3. Do** | 5 | Executes 20 trials correctly, shows random digits used, identifies correct digits (0–4) per trial, counts successes, and summarizes total number of ≥9 correct (0 out of 20). |
| 4 | Accurately carries out simulation but minor arithmetic or transcription error in one trial. |
| 3 | Shows partial data or fewer than 20 trials, but process is mostly correct. |
| 2 | Attempts simulation but misapplies digit assignment or counting (e.g., counts wrong digits). |
| 1 | Provides only verbal summary without supporting data or clear execution evidence. |
| 0 | No simulation or data shown. |
| **4. Conclude** | 5 | States empirical probability (0/20 = 0%), interprets result correctly (“extremely unlikely by chance”), and logically concludes that investigation is warranted. |
| 4 | Correctly computes 0% but conclusion lacks full contextual reasoning (e.g., omits mention of instructor’s suspicion). |
| 3 | Provides correct probability but gives incomplete or ambiguous interpretation (“unlikely” without link to investigation). |
| 2 | Gives incorrect probability or reasoning inconsistent with simulation outcome. |
| 1 | Provides conclusion with no link to results or reasoning. |
| 0 | Missing or irrelevant conclusion. |
