   - üîπ **Strengths in Academic Language**
     - The student demonstrates a good understanding of the statistical concepts and effectively communicates the sequence of steps involved in the analysis. The use of transitional phrases like &quot;Therefore&quot; and &quot;This means&quot; helps in guiding the reader through the reasoning process.
     - The overall structure of the response is logical, with a clear introduction to the statistical problem and a conclusion that summarizes the findings.

   - üî∏ **Areas to Improve (Vocabulary, Grammar, or Clarity)**
     - While the student uses some statistical terminology correctly, there are instances where more precise vocabulary could enhance clarity. For example, terms like &quot;population parameter&quot; and &quot;margin of error&quot; could be better integrated into the explanations.
     - There are minor grammatical errors that affect the overall fluency of the text. The student should focus on maintaining consistent tense and ensuring subject-verb agreement.
     - Some sentences are overly complex, which can lead to confusion. Simplifying these structures would improve clarity.
